# The Re-creation Using Expo
### This is an experimental branch using tab navigation and expo for rendering.

Using expo has the advantage of being easy to demo, quick to build, and generally more stable. This version uses react navigation with navigation tabs, and screens in a separate folder.

Before running the project, ensure that you have yarn installed.

To run the project, navigate to `Mach_Rewards_Expo` directory and run `yarn install` then `yarn expo start`.

From there, you can launch it in the simulators on your computer or on your personal device using the Expo GO app.
